# iotScan
This python script is a tool for scanning IoT networks, identifying devices based on destination ports, and capturing the network packets they generate. It is strictly intended for ethical use, adhering to responsible practices in network security assessment and IoT device management.



Installation of dependencies:
Install Python: If you don't have Python installed already, download and install the latest version from the official Python website: python.org.
Install Tkinter: Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if you don't have it, you can install it using the Python package manager pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Running the script:
Download the script: Download the provided script to your computer.
Run the script: Open a terminal or command prompt in the location where you saved the script and execute it using Python. For example:
Copy code:

python network_scanner.py
Using the script:
Graphical interface: A window for the network scanning application will open. You'll see a "Start Scan" button to initiate the scan and a text area where information about detected IoT devices will be displayed.
Start the scan: Click the "Start Scan" button to begin scanning the network. The application will start capturing and analyzing network packets to identify IoT devices.
Stop the scan: If you want to stop the scan at any time, you can click the "Stop Scan" button. This will halt the packet capture and display the gathered information about detected IoT devices.
View the results: Observe the information displayed in the text area, which will include the MAC address, IP address, device type, and count of packets sent and received by each detected IoT device.
By following these steps, you will be able to successfully run the script and use the network scanning application to monitor IoT devices on your network. Make sure to comply with local laws and regulations regarding network scanning and data privacy.
